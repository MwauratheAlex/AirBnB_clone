# AirBnB_clone
## Project Description
The goal of the project is to deploy on a server a simple copy of the AirBnB website
The complete web application composed by:

1. A command interpreter to manipulate data without a visual interface, like in a Shell
2. A website (the front-end): static and dynamic
3. A database or files that store data (data = objects)
4. An API that provides a communication interface between the front-end and your data (retrieve, create, delete, update them)

## The command interpreter
The command line interpreter will be used to:

1. create your data model
2. manage (create, update, destroy, etc) objects via a console / command interpreter
3. store and persist objects to a file (JSON file)

The first piece is to manipulate a powerful storage system.</br>
This storage engine will give us an abstraction between “My object” and “How they are stored and persisted”.</br>
This means: from your console code (the command interpreter itself) and from the front-end and RestAPI you will build later, you won’t have to pay attention (take care) of how your objects are stored.</br>

This abstraction will also allow you to change the type of storage easily without updating all of your codebase.</br>

The console will be a tool to validate this storage engine</br>

### How to start it
1. clone the repository
2. go to the AirBnB_clone directory
3. Open terminal in the directory
4. Use the command `$ .console.py `
5. Type `help` to get started
